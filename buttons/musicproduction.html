        <h1>MAKE YOUR MUSICAL DREAMS A REALITY!</h1>
        <p>
          Each project is unique and requires a fresh approach and open mind to
          make it come to life. I craft original tracks based off your musical
          vision and tailored to your specific strengths and needs. I expand on
          your creativity, creating a sonic landscape with all the elements that
          make you sound as unique as you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          From bouncing of ideas, composition, arrangement, recording, structure
          to dynamics, my aim is to cultivate and identify your sound for it to
          translate in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are looking to put out a single, make an EP, or create a
          full length record, I will guide you through the process and make the
          end result something that stands out and is commercially competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work only on select projects so I can devote the necessary energy
          and focus creating your own sound that is both meticulously detailed
          and carefully produced from start to finish.

            WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMO AND A PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTION?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              A demo is a relatively simple recording with minimal
              instrumentation intended to demonstrate the song or artist's
              ability. A professional production is intended for commercial
              release and distritribution. It features the best possible
              performances and production, with all the bells and whistles.

            <p>
              Yes I can. However, the process does depend on your writing
              skills. My main goal is to help you create the best song you’ve
              made until date. If I feel like it’s necessary, I may suggest
              rewriting the song together.

            <p>
              I create commercial and “marketable” music for clients. I mostly
              produce pop, EDM, hip-hop, reggae and indie projects. However,
              what I create for my clients isn’t bound by genre. I’ve worked
              across many genres and I can bring that experience and sound to
              your next project.

            <p>
              If you’re a competent singer or band, but have a difficult time
              with writing your own material, you’re not alone. In fact, some of
              the best songs you’ve ever heard had almost nothing to do with the
              people who actually sang them. With your vision, I can taylor a
              song just for you. Aside from myself, I work with a team of
              songwriters and lyricists who are available for melodic & lyrical
              composition.

              Rates vary by the scope and complexity of the project and the

              number of things when I calculate a quote (pre-production, studio
              time, musicians, post-production, etc.). If you would like to
              inquire about rates, simply fill out the Project Planner. It’s a

              This depends on the capacity of your project. Songs with only one
              or two instruments usually take between 4-7 days, while full song
              productions with 5 plus instruments and multiple vocal tracks take
              3-4 weeks. These estimates apply to professional productions.
