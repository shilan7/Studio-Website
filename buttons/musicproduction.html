        <h1>MAKE YOUR MUSICAL DREAMS A REALITY!</h1>
        <p>
          Each project is unique and requires a fresh approach and open mind to
          make it come to life. I craft original tracks based off your musical
          vision and tailored to your specific strengths and needs. I expand on
          your creativity, creating a sonic landscape with all the elements that
          make you sound as unique as you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          From bouncing of ideas, composition, arrangement, recording, structure
          to dynamics, my aim is to cultivate and identify your sound for it to
          translate in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are looking to put out a single, make an EP, or create a
          full length record, I will guide you through the process and make the
          end result something that stands out and is commercially competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work only on select projects so I can devote the necessary energy
          and focus creating your own sound that is both meticulously detailed
          and carefully produced from start to finish.

              WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMO AND A PROFESSIONAL

            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                A demo is a relatively simple recording with minimal
                instrumentation intended to demonstrate the song or artist's
                ability. A professional production is intended for commercial
                release and distritribution. It features the best possible
                performances and production, with all the bells and whistles.

            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                Yes I can. However, the process does depend on your writing
                skills. My main goal is to help you create the best song you’ve
                made until date. If I feel like it’s necessary, I may suggest
                rewriting the song together.

                I create commercial and “marketable” music for clients. I mostly
                produce pop, EDM, hip-hop, reggae and indie projects. However,
                what I create for my clients isn’t bound by genre. I’ve worked
                across many genres and I can bring that experience and sound to
                your next project.

                If you’re a competent singer or band, but have a difficult time
                with writing your own material, you’re not alone. In fact, some
                of the best songs you’ve ever heard had almost nothing to do
                with the people who actually sang them. With your vision, I can
                taylor a song just for you. Aside from myself, I work with a
                team of songwriters and lyricists who are available for melodic
                & lyrical composition.

                Rates vary by the scope and complexity of the project and the

                studio time, musicians, post-production, etc.). If you would

                This depends on the capacity of your project. Songs with only
                one or two instruments usually take between 4-7 days, while full
                song productions with 5 plus instruments and multiple vocal
                tracks take 3-4 weeks. These estimates apply to professional
                productions.
