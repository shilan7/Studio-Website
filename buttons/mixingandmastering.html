        <h1>BREATHE LIFE INTO YOUR SONGS!</h1>
        <p>
          The mixing stage has an enormous impact on the way your song will be
          interpreted. While there is no substitute for a dynamic, exciting
          musical performance, a good mix can enhance every aspect of that
          performance so that the final result truly makes your song stand out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The final mix will let you hear and discern all the sepparate elements
          with detail. It will add sonic depth, width, and clarity enhancing the
          overall picture and feel of your song.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Whether you recorded your music
          at home on modest equipment, or in a professional studio setting, my
          goal is to make your recorded tracks sound their absolute best,
          meticulously balanced, impactful, translatable to all listening
          environments and most importantly, complementary to your song. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To me,
          a good mix exceeds your musical vision. I let your music dictate the
          choice of levels, processing, and effects, so that the true emotional
          message of the song is conveyed to the listener in the best possible
          way.

              HOW DO I PREPARE MY SONG FOR MIXING?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                The best and safest way to prepare your stems for mixing is to
                bounce them all out as separate raw audio files (WAV or AIF) in
                the same sample rate / bit depth in which they were recorded
                without audio clipping. First, take off all the processing you
                may have done. So no EQ, compression or reverb / delays. If
                there are effects that are important to you, include a dry
                version and a version with effects of those tracks. Make sure
                you export tracks that are consolidated or bounced from the
                start point of your song. Check your DAW’s manual on how to do
                this. Label everything clearly so that a bass is a bass, and a
                guitar is a guitar, etc. I ask that you also double check your
                audio files before uploading. Reload them into a new
                Session/Project, checking that they are the correct placement
                and length, Also check that any crossfades have been included
                when consolidating or bouncing in place. If you are using Pro
                Tools or Logic X, you can send the session file (please include
                all audio files). The only thing you must do is convert any midi
                or virtual instrument tracks to audio because I don’t always
                have the same synths or sound banks. Zip all files into a single
                archive and include a rough mix printed from the current version
                of the song.

                re-amp or use an amp simulator on the guitar parts if necessary.
                If you can, always record a clean DI track along with any mic-ed
                up amps.

                me get a better understanding of how you’ve envisioned the final
                version of your work. Let me know what you like about it and
                what you don’t. I might want to go in a different direction, but
                if there are essential elements for you in the rough mix I will
                absolutely respect them.

                If you’re a competent singer or band, but have a difficult time
                with writing your own material, you’re not alone. In fact, some

                with the people who actually sang them. With your vision, I can
                taylor a song just for you. Aside from myself, I work with a
                team of songwriters and lyricists who are available for melodic

                Not at all. I'm well versed in a variety of genres when it comes
                to mixing. I am lucky to have been asked to work on music from a
                lot of different styles and backgrounds. I'm a music fan first
                and I work with songs that excite me.

                Unfortunately, I cannot provide free mixing samples since this
                significantly reduces my turnaround time. I pride myself with
                outstanding customer service, so rest assured you will love your
                final product (and remember you get 2 free revisions!)

                I’m based in New York. Unfortunately, I do not offer the option
                of attended sessions at this time as this would drastically
                increase costs and impact work flow.

                I've spent time working with both analog-hybrid and ITB mixing,
                and have access to both methods. They both have great traits,
                but due to my preferences, workflow, and number of ongoing mix
                projects, I've currently been favoring ITB mixing. Every often I
                would incorporate outboard units to my mix.

                All audio editing and pitch-correction are included in the mix
                package. Automated corrections can sometimes put small things in
                weird places, or even make things TOO perfect sometimes. I
                believe these sorts of adjustments come out better when they are
                personaly judged and manually done to ensure it sounds natural
                and as intended.

                Sometimes audio magic can be accomplished easily, other times it
                can be tough. I am able to remove background noises, bad
                frequencies, and provide many other special touches that can
                make the source sound better, although it is often better to
                re-record any trouble sections to ensure the best end result.

                Because I use a variety of different plugins and outboard units,
                this is not possible. Instead, I can “Stem” all of your
                individual tracks. A stem is basically a “printed” version of,
                let’s say, the vocals. The plugins and processes I used on that
                vocals are “printed” to the track. That way when you open the
                stem in your software, you’ll hear the exact vocals used in the
                mix without needing the plugins. This process is repeated for
                each sound (track) in your song.

                Discounts on multiple songs can be certainly be discussed.
                Please note, discounts can only be negotiated in regards to
                full-scope projects (ie – an EP or album, not individual singles
                over the course of a year).
