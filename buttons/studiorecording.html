        <h1>CAPTURE YOUR SOUND!</h1>
        <p>
          Capturing great performances at the highest possible quality is what
          audio recording is all about. It is a fascinating combination of art
          and science. The right tools can help you achieve phenomenal
          recordings, and the right creative atmosphere can make your recording
          process a magical experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As your recording engineer, I oversee both artistic and technical
          elements of the recording session. My goal is to capture quality
          musical performances, essence and personality onto your recordings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wether itâ€™s recording voice, a full band or a single instrument, I
          believe that attention to detail, use of right technique, combined
          with top of the line equipment can make the difference between a
          decent recording and a remarkable one.

              <p>
                Your session time starts from when you, or your crew, arrive and
                ends once all equipment is packed down and you leave the
                facility. A good setup is key to a smooth session and takes time
                to complete. Please ensure you account for the time it takes you
                to setup, backup session files and pack down your equipment when
                planning your day.

            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                It all depends on how prepared you are. You also need to factor
                the amount of vocal stacks and overdubs needed to complete the
                song (harmonies, backgrounds, doubles, etc.). I have seen
                artists come in knock out their takes in a few hours, on the
                other hand I have seen artists take a whole day to finish a
                song.

                Yes! I record poets, narrators, and other artists not working

                minimum for recording sessions.

            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                Every project will vary, but a good rule of thumb is to book one
                day per song for a typical indie-rock band
                (guitar/bass/drums/vox). A well-rehearsed, four-piece band
                recording a 10-song full-length record can usually get basic
                tracks recorded in 3-5 days and overdubs recorded in 1-2 days.
                Projects with more instrumentation and complexity will take
                longer and projects with less instrumentation and complexity
                will take less time.

                Both! In our planning conversations, weâ€™ll talk about what makes
                the most sense to capture your energy and produce the best
                recordings, and discuss how you intend to use the recording when
                it is finished. If you are recording a song for commercial
                release and distribution, then it is best to record each track
                separately.

                If youâ€™re scheduled for recording and you encounter an
                unexpected conflict, I will work with you to reschedule your
                sessions as soon as possible, but please understand that studio
                and production schedules stay pretty full so flexibility may be
                necessary. Immediate rescheduling may not be possible.
                Individual session musicians, gear rental providers, and
                recording studios may have their own policies about
                rescheduling. <br />
                All payments are non-refundable once paid. If a session is
                canceled, you will receive a company credit in the amount of the
                payments received. Credits can only be applied to the services
                for which they were originally paid. Any credits not used within
                thirty days of the original invoice date will be forfeited.
                Payments made to compensate session musicians, hire gear, or pay
                for studio space are non-refundable and non-creditable.
