      <p>
        Hi, I am Shiron Perera, a Dubai-based music producer, recording, and mixing engineer.
        I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom, and, coincidentally,
        a strong advocate for local indie talent. I am a classically trained Violinist and Pianist
        and an instrumentalist for several Instruments, including Guitar, Drums, Percussion(Western/Eastern),
        and Keys. I am volunteering as a Choir master for The Srilankan community in 
        St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, Dubai. I have worked with several local artists in Srilanka
        and also performed as a session player. Outside the studio, I am a music instructor 
        (for the instruments mentioned above) and a registered, accredited teacher at 
        Trinity College of London and Associate Board of Royal School Of Music Since 2013. 
        I regularly attend my students for Theory and Practical Examinations at Trinity College of London.
      </p>
      
<h1>MY STORY</h1>

 <p>
    My love for music began at an early age since both of my parents have actively participated
     in the local Music scene in Srilanka, and it has been a fundamental part of my life. Throughout
      my childhood, I was encouraged to take lessons and learn as many instruments as possible. 
      By the time I finished high school, I had joined several local bands and performed over the 
      years as a drummer and a keyboardist in Srilanka while I was studying for Higher music studies 
      and teaching as a part-time instructor. As time passed, I learned about Audio and became 
      interested in learning it while I was using it as a Live performer. My newfound interest 
      in music production and audio engineering became a hobby of mine. However, as soon as 
      I realized this was a viable field, I pursued it wholeheartedly. From there, my journey 
      into the professional world of music began. In 2011, I became an in-house music producer and 
      engineer for Serandib Squeeze, a privately owned production studio. In late 2013, I started working 
      freelance out of lyruvmuk Recording Studios, where I developed my skills in recording and 
      mixing for some of the best studio musicians in the region. Towards the end of 2016, 
      I settled in Dubai as a Music teacher, church tech volunteer, and chorister. Since then, 
      my whole career has been a domino effect, with one opportunity leading right into the next.
    </p>

<h1>MY MISSION</h1>
<p>
    As your producer/ engineer, my main goal is to be a true ambassador of your music both 
    in and out of the studio. I am committed to nurturing, directing, and achieving exceptional 
    performances from you as an artist and finding the perfect balance of creative exploration 
    and technical skills to bring your vision to life. Outstanding composition, correct technique 
    use, and creativity are my benchmark for quality. From composing and arranging to producing 
    and mixing, I believe going the extra mile is what makes the difference between the ordinary 
    and the extraordinary. As stated, I love creating music- the process, the challenges, 
    the rewards. Being around creative people and making things that will hopefully last beyond 
    our years is an endless source of inspiration.
      </p>
